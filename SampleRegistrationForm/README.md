## Form Functionality 
1) UIN and Email: The form validates the entry of the University Identification Number (UIN) and ensures a valid email address is provided for successful registration.
2) Semester Selection: Users can choose their desired semester from the drop-down menu, allowing them to register for courses accordingly.
3) Grade Level: The form enables users to specify their grade level as either "Undergraduate" or "Graduate".
4) Course Selection: Users can check the courses they wish to register for from a list of available courses.
5) Submission: After completing the form, users can click the "Submit" button and their registered courses appears on the bottom of the page.

## What I learned
Key learnings include: 
- HTML Structure: Developing the form structure using HTML, understanding form elements, input types, and their attributes
- CSS Styling: Applying CSS styles to enhance the form's visual appeal and layout, making it more user-friendly
- JavaScript Interactivity: Implementing JavaScript to validate user inputs, handle form submissions, and provide real-time feedback to users
- Form Validation: Learning how to validate user inputs to ensure data integrity and prevent errors during form submission.

## Potential Areas for Improvement 
- Course Deletion: Implement a feature to allow users to delete selected courses after form submission, providing greater flexibility in the registration process
- Styling and Layout Refinement: Refine the form's visual aesthetics and layout to make it more appealing and user-friendly
- Database: Store information submitted in the form to a database
