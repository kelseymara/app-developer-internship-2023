## 📚 Front-end code

## Overview 🚀
For my main project, I utilized the AG Grid Component as a replacement for a traditional HTML table, benefiting from its enhanced features and performance. To implement this component, I referred to the official documentation provided by AG Grid (https://www.ag-grid.com/). However, I used TypeScript instead of Javascript, which offered valuable benefits, such as enhanced type safety. 

## File Overview 📂
